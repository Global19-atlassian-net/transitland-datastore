Hello <%= @changeset.user.name.presence %>

Thank you again for submitting a feed to the Transitland Feed Registry! Your feed has been reviewed, and you can now find it in the listings at https://transit.land/feed-registry/

We're starting to import the feed into the Transitland Datastore. This will make available the stops, routes, and schedule data that are contained in the feed. This import process may take a few more hours or days. If we run into any problems along the way, we'll be in touch.

Contributions from community members like you help us build Transitland. If you know of other feeds, please submit them, too!

If you have any questions, you can contact the Transitland team at hello@transitland.org
